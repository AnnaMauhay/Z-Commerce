# Z-Commerce API v1.0.0

Z-Commerce is a RESTful API designed for secure and seamless online shopping experience. This API reliably manages all aspects from user registration, product listings to order fulfilment. It caters to three user roles: Customers, Sellers, and Admin, each with tailored permissions and functionalities. The system utilises APIKeys to deter anonymous calls and endpoints are protected with JWT authentication. The system is rigorously tested through unit and integration tests.

Z-Commerce is deployed on Google Cloud Platform and is accessible [here](https://soy-envelope-405012.lm.r.appspot.com/api/v1/welcome). Comprehensive documentation using Swagger (OAS 3.1) is available on [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/MAUHAYANNALIZA/Z-Commerce/1.0.0) while Postman collections are published [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/30884533/2sA2rCSLaT).
